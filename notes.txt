In Javascript programming there are two types of events:

User Event
1. An example of a user event is a mouse click, with addEventListener:

button.addEventListener('click', () => {

    alert('You clicked me');
});




System Event

1. An example of a System Event is with a setTimeOut

setTimeout(() => {

    alert("Timer finished!");

}, 10000);


Another is the onreadystatechange in an ajax request:

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = () => {
    switch (httpRequest.readyState) {

        case XMLHttpRequest.DONE:
            console.log('Finished);
            break;

    }
}


//System Events in Node.js

1. Data Events - reading data from a url or file
2. Completion Events - when an action is completed
3. Error Events - various handling events .



//Error handling

- we can have errors in our code
- things can go wrong externaly such as servers responding differently as you would expect
- or even the user who is using the application may put in the wrong input.

//in Node.js the asyncronous provides us with an error listener.
